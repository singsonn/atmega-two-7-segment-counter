# atmega-two-7-segment-counter

Code for a 0 to 99 counter using an Atmega328p and 2 7-segment displays, including push buttons to reset the counter, increment and decrement it.

## Deployment

All work was done on a Mac. Check here for easy steps to install `avr-gcc` and `avrdude` tools on your Mac: http://maxembedded.com/2015/06/setting-up-avr-gcc-toolchain-on-linux-and-mac-os-x/

I deployed it using an USBASP ISP programmer. Check `file one-line-compile-program-OSX.txt` for one line command to compile and program it on your Atmega328p.
